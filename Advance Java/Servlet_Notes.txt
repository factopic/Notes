Servlets 

Servlet technology is used to create a web application (resides at server side and generates a dynamic web page).

Servlet technology is robust and scalable because of java language.
Before Servlet, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripting language was common as a server-side programming language.
However, there were many disadvantages to this technology. We have discussed these disadvantages below.

There are many interfaces and classes in the Servlet API such as Servlet, GenericServlet, HttpServlet, ServletRequest, ServletResponse, etc.


What is a Servlet?
Servlet can be described in many ways, depending on the context.

Servlet is a technology which is used to create a web application.
Servlet is an API that provides many interfaces and classes including documentation.
Servlet is an interface that must be implemented for creating any Servlet.
Servlet is a class that extends the capabilities of the servers and responds to the incoming requests. It can respond to any requests.
Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page.


What is a web application?
A web application is an application accessible from the web. A web application is composed of web components like Servlet, JSP, Filter, etc. 
and other elements such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web components typically execute in Web Server and respond to the HTTP request.

CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
CGI technology enables the web server to call an external program and pass HTTP request information to the external program to process the request. 
For each request, it starts a new process.



There are many problems in CGI technology:

If the number of clients increases, it takes more time for sending the response.
For each request, it starts a process, and the web server is limited to start processes.
It uses platform dependent language e.g. C, C++, perl.
Advantages of Servlet
Advantages of Servlet
There are many advantages of Servlet over CGI. The web container creates threads for handling the multiple requests to the Servlet. Threads have many benefits over the Processes such as they share a common memory area, lightweight, cost of communication between the threads are low. The advantages of Servlet are as follows:

Better performance: because it creates a thread for each request, not process.
Portability: because it uses Java language.
Robust: JVM manages Servlets, so we don't need to worry about the memory leak, garbage collection, etc.
Secure: because it uses java language.

web terminology

Servlet Terminology	Description
Website: static vs dynamic	It is a collection of related web pages that may contain text, images, audio and video.
HTTP	It is the data communication protocol used to establish communication between client and server.
HTTP Requests	It is the request send by the computer to a web server that contains all sorts of potentially interesting information.
Get vs Post	It gives the difference between GET and POST request.
Container	It is used in java for dynamically generating the web pages on the server side.
Server: Web vs Application	It is used to manage the network resources and for running the program or software that provides services.
Content Type	It is HTTP header that provides the description about what are you sending to the browser.


Website

Website is a collection of related web pages that may contain text, images, audio and video. 
The first page of a website is called home page. Each website has specific internet address (URL) that you need to enter in your browser to access a website.

Website is hosted on one or more servers and can be accessed by visiting its homepage using a computer network. 
A website is managed by its owner that can be an individual, company or an organization.





A website can be of two types:


Static Website
Dynamic Website
Static website
Static website is the basic type of website that is easy to create. You don't need the knowledge of web programming and database design to create a static website. Its web pages are coded in HTML.

The codes are fixed for each page so the information contained in the page does not change and it looks like a printed page.

Servlet Website2
Dynamic website
Dynamic website is a collection of dynamic web pages whose content changes dynamically. It accesses content from a database or Content Management System (CMS). Therefore, when you alter or update the content of the database, the content of the website is also altered or updated.

Dynamic website uses client-side scripting or server-side scripting, or both to generate dynamic content.

Client side scripting generates content at the client computer on the basis of user input. The web browser downloads the web page from the server and processes the code within the page to render information to the user.

In server side scripting, the software runs on the server and processing is completed in the server then plain pages are sent to the user.

Servlet Website3
Static vs Dynamic website
Static Website	Dynamic Website
Prebuilt content is same every time the page is loaded.	Content is generated quickly and changes regularly.
It uses the HTML code for developing a website.	It uses the server side languages such as PHP,SERVLET, JSP, and ASP.NET etc. for developing a website.
It sends exactly the same response for every request.	It may generate different HTML for each of the request.
The content is only changed when someone publishes and updates the file (sends it to the web server).	The page contains "server-side" code which allows the server to generate the unique content when the page is loaded.
Flexibility is the main advantage of static website.	Content Management System (CMS) is the main advantage of dynamic website.
Next TopicHTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)











HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is application-level protocol for collaborative, distributed, hypermedia information systems. It is the data communication protocol used to establish communication between client and server.

HTTP is TCP/IP based communication protocol, which is used to deliver the data like image files, query results, HTML files etc on the World Wide Web (WWW) with the default port is TCP 80. It provides the standardized way for computers to communicate with each other.

Servlet HTTP4
The Basic Characteristics of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):


It is the protocol that allows web servers and browsers to exchange data over the web.
It is a request response protocol.
It uses the reliable TCP connections by default on TCP port 80.
It is stateless means each request is considered as the new request. In other words, server doesn't recognize the user by default.
The Basic Features of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):

There are three fundamental features that make the HTTP a simple and powerful protocol used for communication:

HTTP is media independent: It specifies that any type of media content can be sent by HTTP as long as both the server and the client can handle the data content.
HTTP is connectionless: It is a connectionless approach in which HTTP client i.e., a browser initiates the HTTP request and after the request is sent the client disconnects from server and waits for the response.
HTTP is stateless: The client and server are aware of each other during a current request only. Afterwards, both of them forget each other. Due to the stateless nature of protocol, neither the client nor the server can retain the information about different request across the web pages.
The Basic Architecture of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):

The below diagram represents the basic architecture of web application and depicts where HTTP stands:

Servlet HTTP5
HTTP is request/response protocol which is based on client/server based architecture. In this protocol, web browser, search engines, etc. behave as HTTP clients and the Web server like Servlet behaves as a server

Next TopicHTTP Requests


← prev








HTTP Requests
The request sent by the computer to a web server, contains all sorts of potentially interesting information; it is known as HTTP requests.

The HTTP client sends the request to the server in the form of request message which includes following information:

The Request-line
The analysis of source IP address, proxy and port
The analysis of destination IP address, protocol, port and host
The Requested URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
The Request method and Content
The User-Agent header
The Connection control header
The Cache control header
HTTP Requests
The HTTP request method indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the Requested URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). This method is case-sensitive and should be used in uppercase.


The HTTP request methods are:

HTTP Request	Description
GET	Asks to get the resource at the requested URL.
POST	Asks the server to accept the body info attached. It is like GET request with extra info sent with the request.
HEAD	Asks for only the header part of whatever a GET would return. Just like GET but with no body.
TRACE	Asks for the loopback of the request message, for testing or troubleshooting.
PUT	Says to put the enclosed info (the body) at the requested URL.
DELETE	Says to delete the resource at the requested URL.
OPTIONS	Asks for a list of the HTTP methods to which the thing at the request URL can respond

next →← prev
Get vs. Post
There are many differences between the Get and Post request. Let's see these differences:

GET	POST
1) In case of Get request, only limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header.	In case of post request, large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body.
2) Get request is not secured because data is exposed in URL bar.	Post request is secured because data is not exposed in URL bar.
3) Get request can be bookmarked.	Post request cannot be bookmarked.
4) Get request is idempotent . It means second request will be ignored until response of first request is delivered	Post request is non-idempotent.
5) Get request is more efficient and used more than Post.	Post request is less efficient and used less than get.

Get vs. Post
GET and POST
Two common methods for the request-response between a server and client are:

GET- It requests the data from a specified resource
POST- It submits the processed data to a specified resource
Anatomy of Get Request
The query string (name/value pairs) is sent inside the URL of a GET request:


GET/RegisterDao.jsp?name1=value1&name2=value2  
As we know that data is sent in request header in case of get request. It is the default request type. Let's see what information is sent to the server.

Servlet Request6
Some other features of GET requests are:

It remains in the browser history
It can be bookmarked
It can be cached
It have length restrictions
It should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
It should only be used for retrieving the data
Anatomy of Post Request
The query string (name/value pairs) is sent in HTTP message body for a POST request:

POST/RegisterDao.jsp HTTP/1.1  
Host: www. javatpoint.com  
name1=value1&name2=value2  
As we know, in case of post request original data is sent in message body. Let's see how information is passed to the server in case of post request.

Servlet Request7
Some other features of POST requests are:

This requests cannot be bookmarked
This requests have no restrictions on length of data
This requests are never cached
This requests do not retain in the browser history



Next TopicServlet Container








Servlet Container
It provides the runtime environment for JavaEE (j2ee) applications. The client/user can request only a static WebPages from the server. If the user wants to read the web pages as per input then the servlet container is used in java.

The servlet container is the part of web server which can be run in a separate process. We can classify the servlet container states in three types:

Servlet Container1
Servlet Container States


The servlet container is the part of web server which can be run in a separate process. We can classify the servlet container states in three types:

Standalone: It is typical Java-based servers in which the servlet container and the web servers are the integral part of a single program. For example:- Tomcat running by itself
In-process: It is separated from the web server, because a different program runs within the address space of the main server as a plug-in. For example:- Tomcat running inside the JBoss.
Out-of-process: The web server and servlet container are different programs which are run in a different process. For performing the communications between them, web server uses the plug-in provided by the servlet container.
The Servlet Container performs many operations that are given below:

Life Cycle Management
Multithreaded support
Object Pooling
Security etc.

Server: Web vs. Application
Server is a device or a computer program that accepts and responds to the request made by other program, known as client. It is used to manage the network resources and for running the program or software that provides services.

There are two types of servers:

Web Server
Application Server
Web Server


Web server contains only web or servlet container. It can be used for servlet, jsp, struts, jsf etc. It can't be used for EJB.

It is a computer where the web content can be stored. In general web server can be used to host the web sites but there also used some other web servers also such as FTP, email, storage, gaming etc.

Examples of Web Servers are: Apache Tomcat and Resin.

Web Server Working
It can respond to the client request in either of the following two possible ways:

Generating response by using the script and communicating with database.
Sending file to the client associated with the requested URL.
The block diagram representation of Web Server is shown below:

Web Server1
Important points

If the requested web page at the client side is not found, then web server will sends the HTTP response: Error 404 Not found.
When the web server searching the requested page if requested page is found then it will send to the client with an HTTP response.
If the client requests some other resources then web server will contact to application server and data is store for constructing the HTTP response.
Application Server

Application server contains Web and EJB containers. It can be used for servlet, jsp, struts, jsf, ejb etc. It is a component based product that lies in the middle-tier of a server centric architecture.

It provides the middleware services for state maintenance and security, along with persistence and data access. It is a type of server designed to install, operate and host associated services and applications for the IT services, end users and organizations.

The block diagram representation of Application Server is shown below:

Web Server2
The Example of Application Servers are:

JBoss: Open-source server from JBoss community.
Glassfish: Provided by Sun Microsystem. Now acquired by Oracle.
Weblogic: Provided by Oracle. It more secured.
Websphere: Provided by IBM.

Content Type is also known as MIME (Multipurpose internet Mail Extension)Type. It is a HTTP header that provides the description about what are you sending to the browser.

MIME is an internet standard that is used for extending the limited capabilities of email by allowing the insertion of sounds, images and text in a message.

The features provided by MIME to the email services are as given below:


It supports the non-ASCII characters
It supports the multiple attachments in a single message
It supports the attachment which contains executable audio, images and video files etc.
It supports the unlimited message length.

Methods of Servlet interface
Servlet interface provides commonbehaviorto all the servlets.Servlet interface defines methods that all servlets must implement.

Servlet interface needs to be implemented for creating any servlet (either directly or indirectly). It provides 3 life cycle methods that are used to initialize the servlet, to service the requests, and to destroy the servlet and 2 non-life cycle methods.

Methods of Servlet interface
There are 5 methods in Servlet interface. The init, service and destroy are the life cycle methods of servlet. These are invoked by the web container.


Method	Description
public void init(ServletConfig config)	initializes the servlet. It is the life cycle method of servlet and invoked by the web container only once.
public void service(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)	provides response for the incoming request. It is invoked at each request by the web container.
public void destroy()	is invoked only once and indicates that servlet is being destroyed.
public ServletConfig getServletConfig()	returns the object of ServletConfig.
public String getServletInfo()	returns information about servlet such as writer, copyright, version etc.

GenericServlet class can handle any type of request so it is protocol-independent.

You may create a generic servlet by inheriting the GenericServlet class and providing the implementation of the service method.


Methods of GenericServlet class
There are many methods in GenericServlet class. They are as follows:

public void init(ServletConfig config) is used to initialize the servlet.
public abstract void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) provides service for the incoming request. It is invoked at each time when user requests for a servlet.
public void destroy() is invoked only once throughout the life cycle and indicates that servlet is being destroyed.
public ServletConfig getServletConfig() returns the object of ServletConfig.
public String getServletInfo() returns information about servlet such as writer, copyright, version etc.
public void init() it is a convenient method for the servlet programmers, now there is no need to call super.init(config)
public ServletContext getServletContext() returns the object of ServletContext.
public String getInitParameter(String name) returns the parameter value for the given parameter name.
public Enumeration getInitParameterNames() returns all the parameters defined in the web.xml file.

 Next TopicLife Cycle Of A Servlet

 
 
 
 Life Cycle of a Servlet (Servlet Life Cycle)
Life Cycle of a Servlet
Servlet class is loaded
Servlet instance is created
init method is invoked
service method is invoked
destroy method is invoked
The web container maintains the life cycle of a servlet instance. Let's see the life cycle of the servlet:

Servlet class is loaded.
Servlet instance is created.
init method is invoked.
service method is invoked.
destroy method is invoked.
Life cycle of a servlet
As displayed in the above diagram, there are three states of a servlet: new, ready and end. The servlet is in new state if servlet instance is created. After invoking the init() method, Servlet comes in the ready state. In the ready state, servlet performs all the tasks. When the web container invokes the destroy() method, it shifts to the end state.


 
1) Servlet class is loaded
The classloader is responsible to load the servlet class. The servlet class is loaded when the first request for the servlet is received by the web container.


2) Servlet instance is created
The web container creates the instance of a servlet after loading the servlet class. The servlet instance is created only once in the servlet life cycle.

3) init method is invoked
The web container calls the init method only once after creating the servlet instance. The init method is used to initialize the servlet. It is the life cycle method of the javax.servlet.Servlet interface. Syntax of the init method is given below:
public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException  
4) service method is invoked
The web container calls the service method each time when request for the servlet is received. If servlet is not initialized, it follows the first three steps as described above then calls the service method. If servlet is initialized, it calls the service method. Notice that servlet is initialized only once. The syntax of the service method of the Servlet interface is given below:

public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)   
  throws ServletException, IOException  
5) destroy method is invoked
The web container calls the destroy method before removing the servlet instance from the service. It gives the servlet an opportunity to clean up any resource for example memory, thread etc. The syntax of the destroy method of the Servlet interface is given below:

public void destroy()  
Next TopicSteps To Create A Servlet Using Tomcat Server









next>> <<prev
Steps to create a servlet example
Steps to create the servlet using Tomcat server
Create a directory structure
Create a Servlet
Compile the Servlet
Create a deployment descriptor
Start the server and deploy the application
There are given 6 steps to create a servlet example. These steps are required for all the servers.

The servlet example can be created by three ways:

By implementing Servlet interface,
By inheriting GenericServlet class, (or)
By inheriting HttpServlet class
The mostly used approach is by extending HttpServlet because it provides http request specific method such as doGet(), doPost(), doHead() etc.


Here, we are going to use apache tomcat server in this example. The steps are as follows:

Create a directory structure
Create a Servlet
Compile the Servlet
Create a deployment descriptor
Start the server and deploy the project
Access the servlet
download this example of servlet
download example of servlet by extending GenericServlet
download example of servlet by implementing Servlet interface

 
1)Create a directory structures
The directory structure defines that where to put the different types of files so that web container may get the information and respond to the client.

The Sun Microsystem defines a unique standard to be followed by all the server vendors. Let's see the directory structure that must be followed to create the servlet.

directory structure of servlet
As you can see that the servlet class file must be in the classes folder. The web.xml file must be under the WEB-INF folder.

2)Create a Servlet
There are three ways to create the servlet.
By implementing the Servlet interface
By inheriting the GenericServlet class
By inheriting the HttpServlet class
The HttpServlet class is widely used to create the servlet because it provides methods to handle http requests such as doGet(), doPost, doHead() etc.
In this example we are going to create a servlet that extends the HttpServlet class. In this example, we are inheriting the HttpServlet class and providing the implementation of the doGet() method. Notice that get request is the default request.

DemoServlet.java
import javax.servlet.http.*;  
import javax.servlet.*;  
import java.io.*;  
public class DemoServlet extends HttpServlet{  
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req,HttpServletResponse res)  
throws ServletException,IOException  
{  
res.setContentType("text/html");//setting the content type  
PrintWriter pw=res.getWriter();//get the stream to write the data  
  
//writing html in the stream  
pw.println("<html><body>");  
pw.println("Welcome to servlet");  
pw.println("</body></html>");  
  
pw.close();//closing the stream  
}}  
3)Compile the servlet
For compiling the Servlet, jar file is required to be loaded. Different Servers provide different jar files:

Jar file	Server
1) servlet-api.jar	Apache Tomcat
2) weblogic.jar	Weblogic
3) javaee.jar	Glassfish
4) javaee.jar	JBoss

Two ways to load the jar file
set classpath
paste the jar file in JRE/lib/ext folder
Put the java file in any folder. After compiling the java file, paste the class file of servlet in WEB-INF/classes directory.

4)Create the deployment descriptor (web.xml file)
The deployment descriptor is an xml file, from which Web Container gets the information about the servet to be invoked.

The web container uses the Parser to get the information from the web.xml file. There are many xml parsers such as SAX, DOM and Pull.

There are many elements in the web.xml file. Here is given some necessary elements to run the simple servlet program.


web.xml file

Description of the elements of web.xml file
There are too many elements in the web.xml file. Here is the illustration of some elements that is used in the above web.xml file. The elements are as follows:


<web-app> represents the whole application.
<servlet> is sub element of <web-app> and represents the servlet.
<servlet-name> is sub element of <servlet> represents the name of the servlet.
<servlet-class> is sub element of <servlet> represents the class of the servlet.
<servlet-mapping> is sub element of <web-app>. It is used to map the servlet.
<url-pattern> is sub element of <servlet-mapping>. This pattern is used at client side to invoke the servlet.
5)Start the Server and deploy the project
To start Apache Tomcat server, double click on the startup.bat file under apache-tomcat/bin directory.

One Time Configuration for Apache Tomcat Server
You need to perform 2 tasks:

set JAVA_HOME or JRE_HOME in environment variable (It is required to start server).
Change the port number of tomcat (optional). It is required if another server is running on same port (8080).
1) How to set JAVA_HOME in environment variable?
To start Apache Tomcat server JAVA_HOME and JRE_HOME must be set in Environment variables.

Go to My Computer properties -> Click on advanced tab then environment variables -> Click on the new tab of user variable -> Write JAVA_HOME in variable name and paste the path of jdk folder in variable value -> ok -> ok -> ok.

Go to My Computer properties:

configuring apache tomcat 1

Click on advanced system settings tab then environment variables:

configuring apache tomcat 2

configuring apache tomcat 3

Click on the new tab of user variable or system variable:

configuring apache tomcat 4

Write JAVA_HOME in variable name and paste the path of jdk folder in variable value:

configuring apache tomcat 2

There must not be semicolon (;) at the end of the path.

After setting the JAVA_HOME double click on the startup.bat file in apache tomcat/bin.
Note: There are two types of tomcat available:
Apache tomcat that needs to extract only (no need to install)
Apache tomcat that needs to install
It is the example of apache tomcat that needs to extract only.

Now server is started successfully.

2) How to change port number of apache tomcat
Changing the port number is required if there is another server running on the same system with same port number.Suppose you have installed oracle, you need to change the port number of apache tomcat because both have the default port number 8080.

Open server.xml file in notepad. It is located inside the apache-tomcat/conf directory . Change the Connector port = 8080 and replace 8080 by any four digit number instead of 8080. Let us replace it by 9999 and save this file.

5) How to deploy the servlet project
Copy the project and paste it in the webapps folder under apache tomcat.

how to deploy servlet in apache tomcat server

But there are several ways to deploy the project. They are as follows:

By copying the context(project) folder into the webapps directory
By copying the war folder into the webapps directory
By selecting the folder path from the server
By selecting the war file from the server
Here, we are using the first approach.

You can also create war file, and paste it inside the webapps directory. To do so, you need to use jar tool to create the war file. Go inside the project directory (before the WEB-INF), then write:

projectfolder> jar cvf myproject.war *  
Creating war file has an advantage that moving the project from one location to another takes less time.

6) How to access the servlet
Open broser and write http://hostname:portno/contextroot/urlpatternofservlet. For example:

http://localhost:9999/demo/welcome

How Servlet works?
It is important to learn how servlet works for understanding the servlet well. Here, we are going to get the internal detail about the first servlet program.

The server checks if the servlet is requested for the first time.

If yes, web container does the following tasks:


loads the servlet class.
instantiates the servlet class.
calls the init method passing the ServletConfig object
else

calls the service method passing request and response objects
The web container calls the destroy method when it needs to remove the servlet such as at time of stopping server or undeploying the project.


 
How web container handles the servlet request?
The web container is responsible to handle the request. Let's see how it handles the request.

maps the request with the servlet in the web.xml file.
creates request and response objects for this request
calls the service method on the thread
The public service method internally calls the protected service method
The protected service method calls the doGet method depending on the type of request.
The doGet method generates the response and it is passed to the client.
After sending the response, the web container deletes the request and response objects. The thread is contained in the thread pool or deleted depends on the server implementation.
What is written inside the public service method?
The public service method converts the ServletRequest object into the HttpServletRequest type and ServletResponse object into the HttpServletResponse type. Then, calls the service method passing these objects. Let's see the internal code:

public void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res)  
        throws ServletException, IOException  
    {  
        HttpServletRequest request;  
        HttpServletResponse response;  
        try  
        {  
            request = (HttpServletRequest)req;  
            response = (HttpServletResponse)res;  
        }  
        catch(ClassCastException e)  
        {  
            throw new ServletException("non-HTTP request or response");  
        }  
        service(request, response);  
    }  
What is written inside the protected service method?
The protected service method checks the type of request, if request type is get, it calls doGet method, if request type is post, it calls doPost method, so on. Let's see the internal code:

protected void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)  
        throws ServletException, IOException  
    {  
        String method = req.getMethod();  
        if(method.equals("GET"))  
        {  
            long lastModified = getLastModified(req);  
            if(lastModified == -1L)  
            {  
                doGet(req, resp);  
            }   
    ....  
    //rest of the code  
        }  
    }
