/************************





The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.

In this page, we will learn about Java exceptions, its type and the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.


What is Exception in Java/****************
Dictionary Meaning: Exception is an abnormal condition.

In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.


What is Exception Handling /****************
Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.


Advantage of Exception Handling
The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application.
 An exception normally disrupts the normal flow of the application that is why we use exception handling. Let's take a scenario:
 
 statement 1;  
statement 2;  
statement 3;  
statement 4;  
statement 5;//exception occurs  
statement 6;  
statement 7;  
statement 8;  
statement 9;  
statement 10;  


Suppose there are 10 statements in your program and there occurs an exception at statement 5, the rest of the code will not be executed i.e. 
statement 6 to 10 will not be executed. If we perform exception handling, the rest of the statement will be executed. 
That is why we use exception handling in Java.


Hierarchy of Java Exception classes


The java.lang.Throwable class is the root class of Java Exception hierarchy which is inherited by two subclasses: 
Exception and Error. A hierarchy of Java Exception classes are given below:



Types of Java Exceptions /****************
There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here, an error is considered as the unchecked exception. According to Oracle, there are three types of exceptions:

Checked Exception
Unchecked Exception
Error



Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions /****************


1) Checked Exception
The classes which directly inherit Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions e.g. IOException, SQLException etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2) Unchecked Exception
The classes which inherit RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.

3) Error
Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.



Java Exception Keywords
There are 5 keywords which are used in handling exceptions in Java.

Keyword	Description
try	The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place exception code. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally. It means, we can't use try block alone.
catch	The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally block later.
finally	The "finally" block is used to execute the important code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
throw	The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
throws	The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It doesn't throw an exception. 
It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. It is always used with method signature.



Java Exception Handling Example  /*************
Let's see an example of Java Exception Handling where we using a try-catch statement to handle the exception.

public class JavaExceptionExample{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   try{  
      //code that may raise exception  Zero cannot be divided
      int data=100/0;  
   }catch(ArithmeticException e){System.out.println(e);}  
   //rest code of the program   
   System.out.println("rest of the code...");  
  }  
}  




Output:

Exception in thread main java.lang.ArithmeticException:/ by zero
rest of the code...


In the above example, 100/0 raises an ArithmeticException which is handled by a try-catch block.


Common Scenarios of Java Exceptions
There are given some scenarios where unchecked exceptions may occur. They are as follows:

1) A scenario where ArithmeticException occurs
If we divide any number by zero, there occurs an ArithmeticException.

int a=50/0;//ArithmeticException  
2) A scenario where NullPointerException occurs
If we have a null value in any variable, performing any operation on the variable throws a NullPointerException.

String s=null;  
System.out.println(s.length());//NullPointerException  
3) A scenario where NumberFormatException occurs
The wrong formatting of any value may occur NumberFormatException. Suppose I have a string variable that has characters, converting this variable into digit will occur NumberFormatException.

String s="abc";  
int i=Integer.parseInt(s);//NumberFormatException  
4) A scenario where ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs
If you are inserting any value in the wrong index, it would result in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException as shown below:

int a[]=new int[5];  
a[10]=50; //ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  


/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Java try block
Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It must be used within the method.

If an exception occurs at the particular statement of try block, the rest of the block code will not execute. So, it is recommended not to keeping the code in try block that will not throw an exception.

Java try block must be followed by either catch or finally block.

Syntax of Java try-catch



try{    
//code that may throw an exception    
}catch(Exception_class_Name ref){}    




Syntax of try-finally block
try{    
//code that may throw an exception    
}finally{}    





Java catch block
Java catch block is used to handle the Exception by declaring the type of exception within the parameter. The declared exception must be the parent class exception ( i.e., Exception) or the generated exception type. However, the good approach is to declare the generated type of exception.

The catch block must be used after the try block only. You can use multiple catch block with a single try block.
